# Nevernester

Nevernester is a Go linter that finds nesting in functions. Many levels of nesting
reduces readability and adds cognitive load.

## Why nevernester?

To many levels of nesting makes it hard to understand what the code does.
Here is a simple example with five levels of nesting being reduced to three:
```go
func calculate(order *Order) int {
    sum := 0
    if order != nil {
        if order.Header.IsValid {
            for _, row := range order.Rows {
                if row.IsValid {
                    sum = sum + row.Price
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

Here the calculate function is easier to understand:
```go
func calculate(order *Order) int {
    sum := 0
    if order == nil {
        return sum
    }

    if order.Header.IsValid {
        sum = getPrice(order.Rows)
    }

    return sum
}

func getPrice(rows []OrderRow) int {
    sum := 0
    for _, row := range rows {
        if row.IsValid {
            sum = sum + row.Price
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

## Installation & usage

```
$go install github.com/raffepaffe/nevernester@latest
$nevernester ./...
```

The default level of nesting is 4. If you want another level, say 5,  use the maxNesting option
```
$nevernester -maxNesting 5 ./...
```

If you want to skip checking tests or benchmarks use the skipTests and skipBenchmarks options
```
$nevernester -skipTests=true -skipBenchmarks=true ./...
```
### Still not convinced?
Linus Torvalds is pretty good developer and the 
[coding style rules](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst) for the linux kernel states:
>The answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix
your program.

Well, most of us are not as cool as Linus so nevernester has a default value of 4 levels. 
You can change that to whatever you want.

## Credits

The idea for this linter came after I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4) discussing 
nesting in code.  
Before I started to code I looked at other linters like [cyclop](https://github.com/bkielbasa/cyclop), 
[nilnil](https://github.com/Antonboom/nilnil) and [wrapcheck](https://github.com/tomarrell/wrapcheck).  
Credit also goes to (in alphabetic order) Anders, Bj√∂rn, Hampus and Oscar for 
helping me becoming a better Go developer.
